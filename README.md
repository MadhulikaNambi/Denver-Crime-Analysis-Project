# Denver-Crime-Analysis-Project
### The government of Denver has provided me with a dataset that has recorded crimes since 2017 and the features of those crimes, for example: the neighborhood it occured it, offense type, offense catergory, etc. Through this project, I am determined to collaborate with the Department of Police to the highest degree. Through this project, I am determined to uncover valuable insights in order to help out the police, but also the kind citizens of Denver. 

Through the analysis, the following research questions were answered:

Q1. Analyze the intervals between each occurrence of a given crime to identify the types of crimes that occur regularly.
Goal: By determining crimes that occur almost on a day to day basis, I can help the Denver Police Department identify the types of crimes they need to address on priority. By reducing the instances of such crimes, the city of Denver will see a downward trend in the number of crimes committed each day. This will in turn bring down the yearly crime rate significantly.

Q2. For crimes that occur occasionally, I will try to identify patterns to understand on which particular days of the week such crimes occur.
Goal : By analyzing the trends of crimes that occur occasionally and identifying the days on which such crimes typically take place, I would like to provide recommendations to the Denver Police Department on how to handle such crimes so that precautionary measures can be taken to prevent them in the future.

Q3. Derive insights on how the nature of the crime affects the time taken to report the crime
Goal: I would like to analyze the time taken for specific crimes to be reported and incase of any delays, understand the underlying cause behind this delay in reporting time. Based on this, I can recommend the Denver Police Department to create public awareness campaigns and provide necessary protocols to encourage victims to report such crimes promptly.

Q4. Predicting the likelihood of a person being in an unsafe neighborhood in Denver based on the individual's coordinates.
Goal: I am attempting to map out potentially unsafe areas across Denver, classify them by likelihood of crime and send out basic safety measures based on an individual's co-ordinates. This will allow people to either steer clear of the shady areas of Denver or be cautious while in those areas. Achieving this will be a win-win scenario as the police will have the access to the same algorithm, so when a person in distress calls a simple check on their location will allow the police to prepare for kind of response they need to engage in, trying to diffuse the situation.
